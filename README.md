# AOC-2021

This repo is to showcase my journey of **Advent of Code 2021**. This is my fist time to participate in AOC event.

> I will be using PHP to solve the puzzle and also try my hands on Kotlin.

It's simple to run:

PHP should be installed on your system.
Clone or Download the source code. 

From within the folder use command:
php index.php

OR

php path_to_folder/index.php

## Happy Coding!!
